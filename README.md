# Introduction
The StrataJazz Desktop Checker is an executable containing a serie of PowerShell(PS1) Scripts to modify registry values for IE and Excel. The original intention is to create a simple PS1 script to update the Internet Explorer automatic prompting for file download after our office workstations upgraded to IE 11. Realizing our clients are facing a similar challenge, I started adding additional PS1 scripts to check/update other desktop requirements in order to utilize all of Microsoft Click-Once features on our StrataJazz database. 

The program basically checks/add our domain to the IE Compatibility View Settings (only check for existance on IE 11), Trusted Sites, and Pop-up blocker exceptions. 

For Excel, the program will enable Developer Macro Settings and add the Documents folder to the Trusted Location.
